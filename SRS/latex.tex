\subsection{Design Constraints}

The design and implementation of the NUTMS system are subject to the following constraints, which define the technological, operational, and regulatory boundaries within which the system must function:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web-Based Architecture }:  
    The system shall be developed strictly as a web-based application. The frontend shall be implemented using React.js to ensure modularity, responsiveness, and maintainability, while the backend shall be developed using Node.js with the Express.js framework to support scalable server-side processing and RESTful API services.

    \item \textbf{Database Technology }:  
    PostgreSQL shall be used as the primary database management system. All data related to users, bookings, routes, tracking information, and system logs shall be stored and managed using PostgreSQL to ensure data consistency, integrity, and support for ACID-compliant transactions.

    \item \textbf{Browser Compatibility }:  
    The system shall be compatible with modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. The design shall avoid browser-specific dependencies to ensure consistent behavior and user experience across supported platforms.

    \item \textbf{Network Dependency }:  
    Continuous internet connectivity is required for core system functionalities, including real-time bus tracking, live notifications, and online seat booking. The system shall be designed to handle temporary network disruptions gracefully where possible.

    \item \textbf{Security and Privacy }:  
    The system shall comply with university IT policies, data protection standards, and applicable data privacy regulations. User authentication, authorization, and secure data transmission shall be mandatory design requirements to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

    \item \textbf{Cost and Resource }:  
    The system shall be developed using open-source and cost-effective tools wherever possible. Deployment and hosting solutions shall prioritize free or low-cost service tiers without compromising system reliability or scalability.

    \item \textbf{Maintainability }:  
    The system architecture shall support ease of maintenance and future enhancements. Source code shall follow standard coding practices, include appropriate documentation, and be managed using version control systems to facilitate collaboration and long-term maintenance.

    \item \textbf{Scalability }:  
    The system design shall allow for future growth in the number of users, routes, and services without requiring significant architectural redesign.

# Transport Management System for Namal University Mianwali


## Overview :
The Namal University Transport Management System (NUTMS) is a digital platform designed to automate and modernize the university's transport operations. The system provides students, faculty, and staff with the ability to book seats online, track buses in real time, and receive instant notifications regarding delays or schedule changes. For administrators and drivers, NUTMS offers a centralized platform to manage routes, monitor trips, and generate accurate reports, improving overall efficiency, safety, and user convenience.

## Problem Statement

Despite operating a fleet of buses, the current system faces several challenges, including manual coordination for route management, seat bookings, and trip updates, which often causes delays and miscommunication. Students and faculty lack real-time updates on bus locations or delays, while limited control over seat allocation can lead to overcrowding during peak hours. Payment and fine processes are not automated, and administrators struggle to track usage, performance, and maintenance without a centralized system. A digital solution is needed to provide online booking, real-time tracking, seat limitation enforcement, notifications, and automated transactions.


## Project Objectives

The key objectives of NUTMS are:

- **Automated Route and Schedule Management**: Optimize bus allocation and trip planning.  
- **Real-Time Tracking and Notifications**: GPS integration for live bus tracking and instant alerts for delays, cancellations, or emergencies.  
- **Seat Limitation Enforcement**: Prevent overbooking and ensure safety compliance.  
- **Centralized Admin Dashboard**: Monitor all bookings, buses, drivers, payments, and generate performance reports.  
- **Data Analytics and Reporting**: Generate automatic reports for transport usage, peak hours, and fuel consumption to aid decision-making.  


## Software Development Methodology :

The Scrum Agile Methodology is used for this project because :

•	It supports iterative and incremental development through short sprints.

•	Allows flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.

•	Encourages regular feedback from the Requirement Provider.

•	Ensures incremental delivery of working modules after each sprint.

•	Promotes team collaboration and continuous improvement.

## User Interface (Frontend)
- **React.js**: Used to build responsive interfaces such as booking forms and tracking maps.  
- **HTML & CSS**: Used for page structure and styling.  
- **Material UI**: Ensures compatibility and smooth display on mobile, tablets, and desktops.  

## Server Logic (Backend)
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Manages authentication, APIs, notifications, and booking operations.  

## Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user details, bookings, routes, and payment information.
